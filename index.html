                <p>I walked through the door with you</p>
                <p>The air was cold</p>
                <p>But something 'bout it felt like home somehow</p>
                <p>And I, left my scarf there at your sister's house</p>
                <p>And you've still got it in your drawer even now</p>
                <br>
                <p>Oh, your sweet disposition</p>
                <p>And my wide-eyed gaze</p>
                <p>We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate</p>
                <p>Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place</p>
                <p>And I can picture it after all these days</p>

                <br>
                <p>And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more</p>
                <p></p>And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all</p>
                <br>
                <p>'Cause there we are again on that little town street</p>
                <p>You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me</p>
                <p>Wind in my hair, I was there</p>
                <p>I remember it all too well</p>
                <br>
                <p>Photo album on the counter</p>
                <p>Your cheeks were turning red</p>
                <p>You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed</p>
                <p>And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team</p>
                <p>You told me 'bout your past thinking your future was me</p>
                <br>
                <p>And you were tossing me the car keys</p>
                <p>"F- the patriarchy" keychain on the ground</p>
                <p>We were always skipping town</p>
                <p>And I was thinking on the drive down</p>
                <p>Any time now, he's gonna say it's love</p>
                <p>ou never called it what it was</p>
                <br>
                <p>'Til we were dead and gone and buried</p>
                <p>Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same</p>
                <p>After three months in the grave</p>
                <p>And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you</p>
                <p>But all I felt was shame, and you held my lifeless frame</p>
                <br>
                <p>And I know it's long gone, and there was nothing else I could do</p>
                <p>And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to</p>
                <br>
                <p>'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night</p>
                <p>We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light</p>
                <p>Down the stairs, I was there</p>
                <p>I remember it all too well</p>
                <br>
                <p>And there we are again when nobody had to know</p>
                <p>You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath</p>
                <p>Sacred prayer and we'd swear</p>
                <p>To remember it all too well</p>
                <br>
                <p>Well, maybe we got lost in translation</p>
                <p>Maybe I asked for too much</p>
                <p>But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up</p>
                <p>Running scared, I was there</p>
                <p>I remember it all too well</p>

            <!-- And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
            So casually cruel in the name of being honest
            I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
            'Cause I remember it all, all, all

            They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
            Every time you double-cross my mind
            You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine
            And that made me want to die
            The idea you had of me, who was she?
            A never-needy ever, lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you

            Not weeping in a party bathroom
            Some actress asking me what happened
            You, that's what happened, you
            You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
            Sipping coffee like you're on a late night show
            But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
            And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning 21"

            Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
            I'd like to be my old self again
            But I'm still trying to find it
            After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
            Now you mail back my things, and I walk home alone
            But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
            'Cause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me
            You can't get rid of it
            'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

            'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
            Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
            It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
            Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
            Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
            It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

            And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punchline goes
            "I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
            From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
            I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

            And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
            Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
            'Cause in this city's barren cold, I still remember the first fall of snow
            And how it glistened as it fell
            I remember it all too well

            Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
            Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
            Just between us, I remember (just between us) it all too well

            Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
            Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
            It was rare, you remember it all too well

            Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
            Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
            It was rare, you remember it

            Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
            Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
            It was rare, you remember it

            Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
            Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
            Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
            It was rare, you remember it -->
